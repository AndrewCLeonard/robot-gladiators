# robot-gladiatiors JS Project, Bootcamp Module 3

## Questions

## Iterations

IMPROVEMENTS

MVP = click on ATTACK button, return random win/loss result

Iteration #2:

start by hardcoding the player wins and the computer loses, don't worry about the random numbers at first

-   track if game is active or not
    -   how will "restart game" do the restart?
    -   keep win/loss record on future iteration
-   eventListener for "attack" button

    -   randomly subtract health from the enemy
    -   randomly subtract health from the player
    -   track health of characters
    -   display message about how much damage was done

-   check if health >= 0
-   if it is, continue fighting
-   if not, declare the winner

## Lesson 3

### Roadmap
